PowerConnect
============

A Peer-to-Peer Renewable Energy Trading Smart Contract
------------------------------------------------------

PowerConnect is a Clarity smart contract designed to facilitate direct, decentralized trading of renewable energy between prosumers (producers/consumers) on the Stacks blockchain. It establishes a transparent and automated marketplace for individuals to list, purchase, and exchange energy, complete with secure escrow payments and a dynamic reputation system to foster trust within the community.

‚ú® Features
----------

-   **Energy Listing:** Prosumers can list their surplus renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind, hydro) for sale, specifying the amount, price, type, location, and expiry.

-   **Automated Matching:** An intelligent matching algorithm helps buyers find the best energy listings based on price, energy type, desired amount, location proximity (conceptual in this contract, often handled off-chain), and seller reputation.

-   **Secure Escrow Payments:** Funds for energy purchases are held in escrow until the buyer confirms successful delivery, ensuring a secure transaction for both parties.

-   **Reputation Tracking:** A built-in reputation system tracks successful trades for each user, providing a trust score that influences matching and incentivizes reliable participation.

-   **Platform Fees:** A small, transparent platform fee is collected on successful trades to support the ecosystem.

-   **Flexible Purchases:** Buyers can purchase the full listed amount or a partial amount of energy from a listing.

### Private Functions

Private functions are internal helper functions that can only be called from within the contract itself.

-   `(calculate-platform-fee (amount uint))`: Computes the platform fee for a given `amount` based on `platform-fee-bps`.

-   `(validate-listing-params (energy-amount uint) (price-per-kwh uint))`: Checks if energy `amount` is within min/max limits and `price-per-kwh` is positive.

-   `(min-uint (a uint) (b uint))`: Returns the minimum of two unsigned integers.

-   `(max-uint (a uint) (b uint))`: Returns the maximum of two unsigned integers.

-   `(update-reputation (user principal) (successful bool))`: Updates a user's `total-trades`, `successful-trades`, and `reputation-score` based on trade outcome.

### Public Functions

Public functions can be called by any authorized user and modify the contract's state.

-   `(create-energy-listing (energy-amount uint) (price-per-kwh uint) (energy-type (string-ascii 20)) (location (string-ascii 50)) (duration-blocks uint))`:

    -   Allows a prosumer to create a new energy listing.

    -   Requires valid `energy-amount`, `price-per-kwh`, and `duration-blocks`.

    -   Returns the new `listing-id` on success.

-   `(purchase-energy (listing-id uint) (energy-amount uint))`:

    -   Enables a buyer to purchase energy from an active listing.

    -   Transfers the total price from the buyer to the contract's escrow.

    -   Creates a new trade record and updates the listing's remaining energy.

    -   Returns the new `trade-id` on success.

-   `(confirm-delivery (trade-id uint))`:

    -   Initiates an automated search for the best energy listing based on specified criteria.

    -   Uses a `fold` operation to iterate and score potential listings.

    -   If a suitable match is found, it automatically calls `purchase-energy` to execute the trade.

    -   Returns the `trade-id` if a trade is executed, or `err-not-found` if no suitable match is found.

### Read-Only Functions

Read-only functions allow users to query the contract's state without making any modifications.

üöÄ Usage
--------

### Creating an Energy Listing

Prosumers can list their energy:

```
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect create-energy-listing u500 u1000 "solar" "Lagos, Nigeria" u100)
;; Lists 500 kWh of solar energy at 1000 microSTX/kWh, located in Lagos, Nigeria, for 100 blocks.

```

### Purchasing Energy

Buyers can purchase energy from an existing listing:

```
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect purchase-energy u1 u250)
;; Purchases 250 kWh from listing ID 1.

```

### Confirming Delivery

Once energy is delivered, the buyer confirms:

```
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect confirm-delivery u1)
;; Confirms delivery for trade ID 1, releasing funds to seller and updating reputations.

```

### Auto-Matching Energy Trade

Buyers can use the automated matching system:

```
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect auto-match-energy-trade u1200 u300 "wind" u50 u600)
;; Searches for a wind energy listing, up to 1200 microSTX/kWh, for 300 kWh, within 50 km (conceptual),
;; and from sellers with at least 600 reputation. If found, automatically executes the purchase.

```

### Querying Data

You can retrieve listing, trade, and reputation details:

```
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect get-energy-listing u1)
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect get-trade-details u1)
(contract-call? 'SP123...my-contract.power-connect get-user-reputation 'SPABC...user-address)

```

‚öñÔ∏è Reputation System
--------------------

The `user-reputation` map tracks each user's trading history and reputation score.

-   Initially, users have a score of `u500`.

-   Upon `confirm-delivery` (successful trade):

    -   `reputation-score` increases by `u10`.

    -   `successful-trades` increments.

    -   `total-trades` increments.

-   If a trade is not confirmed (e.g., dispute resolution, though not implemented in this basic contract, would lead to `successful` being `false` for the non-performing party):

    -   `reputation-score` decreases by `u20`.

-   Reputation score is capped between `u0` and `u1000`.

This system encourages honest and reliable participation in the energy trading network.
